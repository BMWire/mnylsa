# Moneylisa

This is a project created in fulfilment of the requirements of the CSC 227 course unit as a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at the University of Nairobi.

## The project

Moneylisa is a platform that seeks to help artists - whether photographers or painters - to make money by leveraging their skills. Whether it is by selling their art or "advertising" their completed works, Moneylisa brings their clients closer to them.
